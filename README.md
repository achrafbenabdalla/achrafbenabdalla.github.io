# Automating Infrastructure Deployment with Github, Github pages, Github Actions  

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project is simplified for our static website since our portfolio contains only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We automate the deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the automation of deployment using GitHub Actions. Whenever changes are made and pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions will be triggered, and the updates will be automatically reflected on the deployed website hosted on GitHub Pages. This ensures that the latest version of the site is always live without manual intervention, streamlining the development and deployment process.
## Key Features

* **Automated Deployment:** Changes pushed to the GitHub repository automatically trigger a deployment process, ensuring the website is always up to date.

* **Continuous Integration:** Integration of GitHub Actions provides seamless continuous integration, allowing for efficient and error-free updates.

* **Static Website Hosting:** Utilizes GitHub Pages for hosting, providing a simple and reliable platform for static websites.

* **Effortless Maintenance:** Simplifies the process of maintaining and updating the portfolio by automating routine tasks, reducing the potential for errors and saving time.
